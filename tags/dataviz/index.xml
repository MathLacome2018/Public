      <description>Recently, interest for GPS-embedded accelerometers variables has grown. Indeed, while classic locomotors variables give many pieces of information about the external load, little is known about how playersâ€™ cope with this load in return. GPS-embedded accelerometers, in return, allow the calculation of promising variables and among them, Force load. Force load refers to the sum of estimated ground reaction forces during all foot impacts, assessed via the accelerometer-derived magnitude vector ( Lacome et al.</description>

      <description>When it comes to providing reports to the coaching staff or players, the first impression is always important. Within 5 seconds, a coach can decide not to have a look at your report. Within 5 seconds, it is always the design and overall aspect of the report which makes a difference, rarely the underlying analyses. In its brilliant paper Want to see my report, Coach, Martin Buchheit talk about the importance of effective sports science support and rank the attractiveness of the reports among the most important elements to take into account.</description>
