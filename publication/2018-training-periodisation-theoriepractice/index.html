  <meta name="description" content="Purpose: To describe the training periodization in Rugby-7s players competing in the Sevens World Series during a non-Olympic season. Methods: Workload data were collected over a 33-week period in twelve male players participating in a full competitive season. Workload was quantified using session RPE and GPS-derived data during training and competition. Self-reported wellbeing was assessed using a questionnaire. Each variable was analysed weekly and through 5 mesocycles (Pre-season, In-season 1-4), each of which ended with competition blocks. Results: The perceived load decreased throughout the season for the full squad (-68 ± 26% between pre-season and final competitive block, large effect) and when unavailable players were removed from the analysis (-38 ± 42%, moderate). Weekly perceived load was highly variable with a typical periodization in 4 phases during each mesocycle (regeneration, training overload, taper and competition). During the pre-season, the workload was higher during the overload training phase than during the competitive period (range: &#43;23-59%, large to very large, for the distance covered above individual maximal aerobic speed and the number of accelerations). This observation no longer persisted during the in-season. The wellbeing score decreased almost certainly from In-3 (moderate). Conclusions: These results highlighted the apparent difficulty in maintaining high-load training periods throughout the season in players engaged on the Sevens World Series despite ~4-7 training weeks separating each competitive block. This observation was likely explained by the difficulties inherent to the Sevens World Series (risk of contact injury, calendar and multiple long-haul travel) and potentially by limited squad rotation policies.">

    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p class="pub-abstract" itemprop="text">Purpose: To describe the training periodization in Rugby-7s players competing in the Sevens World Series during a non-Olympic season. Methods: Workload data were collected over a 33-week period in twelve male players participating in a full competitive season. Workload was quantified using session RPE and GPS-derived data during training and competition. Self-reported wellbeing was assessed using a questionnaire. Each variable was analysed weekly and through 5 mesocycles (Pre-season, In-season 1-4), each of which ended with competition blocks. Results: The perceived load decreased throughout the season for the full squad (-68 ± 26% between pre-season and final competitive block, large effect) and when unavailable players were removed from the analysis (-38 ± 42%, moderate). Weekly perceived load was highly variable with a typical periodization in 4 phases during each mesocycle (regeneration, training overload, taper and competition). During the pre-season, the workload was higher during the overload training phase than during the competitive period (range: +23-59%, large to very large, for the distance covered above individual maximal aerobic speed and the number of accelerations). This observation no longer persisted during the in-season. The wellbeing score decreased almost certainly from In-3 (moderate). Conclusions: These results highlighted the apparent difficulty in maintaining high-load training periods throughout the season in players engaged on the Sevens World Series despite ~4-7 training weeks separating each competitive block. This observation was likely explained by the difficulties inherent to the Sevens World Series (risk of contact injury, calendar and multiple long-haul travel) and potentially by limited squad rotation policies.</p>
