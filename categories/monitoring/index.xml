      <description>In my last post, we saw a method to perform simple between-players normalisation to get first insights on players’ “performance” status. Like every model, this one has some known limitations and thus, it is important to use it in combination with other models to create a full stream of information. To overcome the limitations inherent to the use of this method, examining the dose-response relationship between workload and immediate physiological responses (or more simply generic models of work efficiency, i.</description>
