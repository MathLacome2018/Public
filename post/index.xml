      <description>We (Martin Buchheit, Ben M. Simpson &amp;amp; me) recently published a paper dealing with monitoring training status with GPS. If this paper, we argue that “Since player activity patterns are more heavily influenced by contextual variables (e.g. rules, coaches’ interventions, scoreline, drills used) than players’ current fitness status 1, locomotor-related variables (level 1 and 2) may not be the most appropriate to directly monitor players’ training status.”
We proposed that player activity normalisation relative to the mean or median of the team (or a sub-group of player) could be another way to look at the data.</description>

      <description>Have you ever collected data with your team and wonder what you can do with them? How to get insights from them and how to communicate clearly your results?
… You’re not alone! I asked myself this question millions of times over the last 10 years.
I will try to post here on a regular basis. I will try to write the posts I would have love to read years before.</description>
